# KISS Development Rules
- Always aim for the simplest solution that meets the project requirements.
- Avoid over-complicating designs or implementationsâ€”choose straightforward approaches.
- Break problems into manageable, clearly defined components.
- Regularly refactor code to eliminate unnecessary complexity and redundancy.
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions to enhance readability.
- Document only what is essential to understand the code's purpose and functionality.
- Implement features incrementally and only when needed, avoiding premature optimization.
- Continuously evaluate design choices by asking, "Is there a simpler way to achieve this?"
