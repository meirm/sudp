# Agentic IDE Context Summarization and Transfer Guidelines
- Continuously track and record key context, instructions, and development decisions as the session evolves.
- Periodically, or upon request, generate a concise summary of the current context window. This summary should capture:
  - Key topics discussed
  - Recent modifications and decisions
  - Outstanding tasks and unresolved issues
- Structure the summary to include only the essential context required for continuity, avoiding extraneous details.
- When initiating a new chat with a fresh context window, provide:
  - The generated summary of previous context
  - A clear set of instructions outlining the agentâ€™s role, current development state, and goals
  - Brief background information on the project, including design decisions and known challenges
- Ensure that both the summary and the new instructions are updated, accurate, and actionable.
- On context reset or transition, verify that the summary highlights the most critical information to ensure seamless continuity in development.
- Use this process to maintain a consistent and coherent development workflow across multiple sessions.
