# Development Context Summary

## Current Development State

### Completed Components (v0.1.0)
1. Core UDP Packet Handling
   - `UDPPacket` class with serialization/deserialization
   - Comprehensive validation and error handling
   - Full test coverage

2. UDP Socket Management
   - `UDPSocket` class with async operations
   - Successfully tested with netcat
   - Example echo server implementation

### Key Decisions and Findings
1. Port and Address Standardization
   - Using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for consistency across systems
   - Default client port changed to `5005`
   - Test server port set to `5006`
   - WebSocket server port: `8080`

2. Testing Approach
   - Unit tests with pytest
   - Integration tests with netcat
   - Manual testing via echo server example

### Next Steps
1. Logging Infrastructure (Next Component)
   - Set up in `src/common/logging.py`
   - Configure log levels and rotation
   - Implement performance metrics
   - Add error tracking

2. Pending Components
   - Basic client implementation
   - Basic server implementation
   - Configuration management
   - CLI development

## Testing Instructions
1. Run echo server example:
   ```bash
   ./examples/echo_server.py
   ```

2. Test with netcat:
   ```bash
   nc -u 127.0.0.1 5005
   ```

## Known Issues/Considerations
1. Address Resolution
   - Must use IP addresses (127.0.0.1) instead of hostnames (localhost)
   - Particularly important on macOS

2. Port Usage
   - Default ports standardized for consistency
   - Multiple port requirements documented in USER_STORY.md

## Development Environment
- Python 3.8+
- pytest for testing
- asyncio for async operations
- Requirements in requirements.txt
