### Key Decisions and Findings
1. Port and Address Standardization
   - Using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for consistency across systems
   - Default client port changed to `5005`
   - Test server port set to `5006`
   - WebSocket server port: `8080`

2. Package Management
   - Using `pyproject.toml` as the single source for package configuration
   - Entry points defined via `project.scripts` instead of script files
   - Development dependencies properly specified
   - Installation tested in both normal and editable modes

3. Testing Approach
   - Unit tests with pytest
   - Integration tests with unittest
   - Performance benchmarks with statistics
   - Manual testing via echo server example
   - Coverage tracking with pytest-cov

4. Multi-instance Architecture
   - Each instance has its own configuration file
   - Instance-specific log directories
   - Instance-specific PID files
   - Automatic port allocation for conflict avoidance
   - Instance metadata for status reporting
   - Command-line arguments properly passed to configuration

4. Error Recovery Architecture
   - Packet acknowledgment system for reliable delivery
   - Sequence numbering to detect packet loss
   - Exponential backoff with jitter for reconnection attempts
   - Buffer management for unacknowledged packets
   - Heartbeat mechanism to detect connection health
   - Metadata in packets for tracking and acknowledgment

### Next Steps
1. WebSocket Integration (Release 0.7.0)
   - Implement WebSocket server
   - Implement WebSocket client
   - UDP packet encapsulation in WebSocket frames
   - Basic error handling

2. Testing and Documentation (Release 0.9.0)
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Installation guides
   - API documentation
   - Example usage scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks

3. Pending Components
   - Basic client implementation
   - Configuration management
   - Logging infrastructure

## Testing Instructions
1. Run echo server example:
   ```bash
   ./examples/echo_server.py
   ```

2. Test with netcat:
   ```bash
   nc -u 127.0.0.1 5005
   ```

3. Test daemon commands:
   ```bash
   # Server daemon (default instance)
   sudpd start
   sudpd status
   sudpd stop

   # Server daemon (named instance)
   sudpd start --instance test1 --port 11224
   sudpd status --instance test1
   sudpd stop --instance test1
   
   # List all instances
   sudpd list
   ```

4. Run integration tests:
   ```bash
   # Run all integration tests
   python src/tests/integration/run_tests.py
   
   # Run specific test types
   python src/tests/integration/run_tests.py --type multi_instance
   python src/tests/integration/run_tests.py --type tcp_server
   python src/tests/integration/run_tests.py --type performance
   
   # Run with verbose output
   python src/tests/integration/run_tests.py --verbose
   ```

5. Test error recovery:
   ```bash
   # Start the server
   sudpd start --instance recovery_demo --port 11230
   
   # Run the error recovery demo
   python examples/error_recovery_demo.py
   
   # In another terminal, stop the server to simulate failure
   sudpd stop --instance recovery_demo
   
   # Then restart it to see reconnection
   sudpd start --instance recovery_demo --port 11230
   ```

## Known Issues/Considerations
1. Address Resolution
   - Must use IP addresses (127.0.0.1) instead of hostnames (localhost)
   - Particularly important on macOS

2. Port Usage
   - Default ports standardized for consistency
   - Multiple port requirements documented in USER_STORY.md
   - Automatic port allocation available with `--port 0`

3. Python Environment
   - Requires Python 3.8+
   - Commands installed in user's Python environment bin directory
   - PATH must include Python's bin directory

4. Error Recovery
   - Packet retransmission may cause duplicate packets
   - Buffer size limits the number of unacknowledged packets
   - Reconnection attempts are limited to prevent resource exhaustion
   - Heartbeat mechanism adds minimal overhead
   - Connection health monitoring may have false positives

## Development Environment
- Python 3.8+
- Modern packaging with pyproject.toml
- Development tools:
  - pytest & pytest-cov for testing
  - black for formatting
  - flake8 for linting
  - mypy for type checking
  - isort for import sorting
