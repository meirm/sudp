# SUDP (Secure UDP over WebSocket) Roadmap

## Project Summary

SUDP is a Python-based tunneling solution that enables secure and reliable transmission of UDP packets over WebSocket connections. The system consists of client and server components that work together to encapsulate UDP traffic within WebSocket frames, allowing UDP communication to traverse networks that might otherwise block or restrict UDP traffic.

### Core Components

1. **SUDP Client**
   - Captures UDP packets from local applications
   - Encapsulates packets into WebSocket frames
   - Manages WebSocket connection to the server
   - Supports both daemon and interactive modes

2. **SUDP Server**
   - Receives WebSocket frames from clients
   - Decapsulates UDP packets
   - Forwards packets to their intended destinations
   - Handles multiple client connections

3. **Configuration System**
   - YAML-based configuration files
   - Instance-specific settings support
   - Environment-based configuration overrides

4. **Security Layer**
   - Nginx reverse proxy for initial security
   - SSL/TLS termination
   - Basic authentication support
   - Future-ready for direct TLS implementation
